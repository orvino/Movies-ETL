# Movies-ETL
##Purpose of this repository
This repository was created to aid Britta in createing an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables.  Along with refactoring code, the goal was to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
